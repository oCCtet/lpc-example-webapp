README for web-app
==================

The web-app is an example service software (daemon) that provides a custom
WebUI application and its backend service, designed to work on a Luminato
LPC module.

Luminato management console (the main WebUI) fetches the /app.json application
definition file from the service via HTTP GET request; it then fetches additional
files as directed by the abovementioned definition file.

The rest of the functionality serves any requests the application itself may
make, thus are highly application-dependent.
